description: Default best‑practice prompting rules for this repository.
---
## Scope
These rules act as fallback when no specific `.mdc` matches.

- Prefer incremental, test‑driven edits.
- After code generation, always output an **ARMv8‑only** explanation.
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous.
